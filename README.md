I want to be able to play a popular dice game with my friends by the end of these modules.
That's basically all there is to it, but I'll put the whole online session thing as a bonus, it's pretty scary as a complete beginner.

MVP would be a good looking site with basic interactable dices.

For responsive web design I'd have to go for a mobile first approach, and use grid styling.

Goals:
1. **Build a static site with HTML and responsive CSS** (weeks 1 + 2)
    - A landing page
    - Other static pages like an “about” page or a “legal” page.
2. **Create a web backend with dynamic routing** (weeks 2 + 3)
    - The barebone structure of a backend application with a framework
    - Definition of the various routes (URLs) needed for the application (and all its endpoints)
    - Initial static (HTML- & CSS-only) pages with static fake data (as there is no integration with a database or backend yet)
    - Forms to input data that is not yet stored in the backend (e.g., contact form)
3. **Store data in a database and render its content on pages dynamically** (weeks 4, 5, 6)
    - Schema and models for the various data sets of your application
    - Pages for all the different routes previously defined
    - Integration between forms and database
    - Dynamic rendering of content from the database on various pages
4. **Deploy the website** (week 7)
    - Upload the website to a web server
    - Use a production-ready database that works on a web server
    - Security Validation
    - Authentication system
5. **Polish for clean code and best practices** (week 8)
    - Unit tests to make the code more robust
    - Refactoring of the code base to make the code more maintainable



notes for ID19:
design process starting out with a orange-pinkish color-theme, because of the emotions and actions accredited to them.
Trying the mobile first approach to dull down what's really needed on the eventual website.
